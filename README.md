# LearnedCode

This is a git for sharing 'learned' code.

Basic idea? That we all inevitable learn *something* when working on a project. This git is here to share, *'snippets'* of code that encapsulate your hard work and late nights. 

Share into divided folders (based on Language||libs||frameworks)

Feel free to comment in your story (in the file you upload) of how you got to this shinny peace of code.


Be curtious and be kind, we were all noobs at one point in the past.


Have fun! Coding is awesome, there's a reason we all come back to the computer. Come back to the code and write a few more lines, no matter the time of day.


Ok great!
